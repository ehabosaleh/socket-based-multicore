# socket-based-multicore
If we want to connect two nodes in a network, we usually open a channel and direct one of the nodes to listen to a specific port at a specific IP address while the other establishes the connection.  In networking terminology we call the listener node the server and the other is the client. On the other side, we refer to this process of establishing a connection as Socket Programming. 
In the real world, these nodes could be any terminal (PCs, mobile phones, etc.) controlled by a user. However, the goal of this experiment is to see if we can use the socket programming concept to connect cores belonging to the same processor and participate in solving a mathematical problem. 
We used the Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2430M CPU, which has two physical cores each can run two threads simultaneously, for a total of four threads. We will use these four threads as standalone cores despite the fact that we only  have two cores. 
##  Problem to be solved:
we aim to solve the domain partioning problem that relies on Riemman Sum concept. 
<p>In mathematics, a Riemann sum is a certain kind of approximation of an integral by a finite sum. One very common application is approximating the area of functions or lines on a graph, but also the length of curves and other approximations. </p>

<p>The sum is calculated by partitioning the region into shapes (rectangles, trapezoids, parabolas, or cubics) that together form a region that is similar to the region being measured, then calculating the area for each of these shapes, and finally adding all of these small areas together. This approach can be used to find a numerical approximation for a definite integral even if the fundamental theorem of calculus does not make it easy to find a closed-form solution.</p>
